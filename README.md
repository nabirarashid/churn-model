# churn-model
using tensorflow to build and train a machine learning model that predicts customer churn for a bank
- designed to identify whether a customer is likely to discontinue their services based on key factors such as:
  - gender, seniority, online backup, online security, phone services & other relevant customer attributes
- currently has an accuracy of 77% - can improve this with a bigger epoch size since i only did 200
- ignore how i have 2 models loaded LOL i realized .h5 isn't supposed to be used anymore
